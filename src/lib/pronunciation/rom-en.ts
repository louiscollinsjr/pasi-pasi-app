// --- Romani to English Pronunciation Guide (Vlax Dialect) ---
//
// This file provides pronunciation rules for native English speakers learning Romani.
// It is based on the common Vlax Romani orthography, which is largely phonetic.
// Unlike English, letters in Romani almost always represent a single, consistent sound.
//
// NOTE: The order of these rules is important. Longer patterns (like 'čh') must
// come before shorter ones (like 'č' or 'h') to be matched correctly.
